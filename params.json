This serves as a building block to\r\nbuild the entire decay tree in an extremely flexible fashion.  The\r\nclass provides a phase space event generation interface by wrapping\r\naround the `ROOT` class `TGenPhaseSpace`.  It also supports\r\nimplementing branching fractions for different decay channels by\r\nassigning weights to each decay node.\r\n\r\n# Doxygen HTML documentation\r\n\r\n<http://suvayu.github.com/TwoBodyDecayGen/html/>\r\n","name":"Twobodydecaygen"}
